# Sheilding-against-Web-Attacks-
An intrusion detection system (IDS) is designed to monitor all inbound and
outbound network activity and identify any suspicious patterns that may indicate
a network or system attack from someone attempting to break into or compromise
a system. IDS is a passive-monitoring system, since the main function of an IDS
product is to warn you of suspicious activity taking place not prevent them. An
IDS essentially reviews your network traffic and data and will identify probes,
attacks, exploits and other vulnerabilities. IDSs can respond to the suspicious
event in one of several ways, which includes displaying an alert, logging the
event, or even paging an administrator. The proposed protocol called Password
Guessing Resistant Protocol (PGRP), helps in preventing such attacks and
provides a pleasant login experience for legitimate users, helps in preventing such
attacks. PGRP limits the number of logins attempts for unknown users to one, and
then challenges the unknown user with an Automated Turing Test (ATT). We
provide an analysis on various defense mechanisms against web code injection
attacks. We see that attack prevention may take place either at the server or the
client-side. Our results show that it is possible to detect low false positive rate and
we can prevent from insider attack by providing high level of encryption by using
random generated questions and by securing the database by sending encrypted
otp via mail and then authentication is done.
